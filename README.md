What is AardvarkCoin?
----------------

Aardvark is launching as real crypto but it’s also a gamified research project—kind of a virtual fire drill—to see how an average joe altcoin fork might go about securing itself with quantum-resistant technology.  Our project forks Bitcoin code to launch a new zero-premine community project with a quick sprint from Bitcoin’s code and signature system to quantum-resistant solution, if one is available today. We intend to document the process and track it as a research contribution. At a very small scale and in limited scope, the project will show the steps needed to outfit Bitcoin with a quantum-resistant shell.


A simulated drill with real crypto
----------------
Our hypothesis is that at some point in the next 2 to 20 years quantum computers will crack the elliptic curve signature scheme of Bitcoin—and many other currencies that use a public/private key system. The question isn’t if quantum computing is capable of cracking Bitcoin’s signatures, it’s when.  While there won’t be a single, perfect solution for all projects when this occurs, but one thing is for certain: projects will need to adapt.  

We’re taking a research-based approach to this, looking at this as a game. Consider the following players:

(i) Offense. The Offense in a quantum attack is an unknown mix of well-funded private and state actors that  will develop quantum resistant technology and use it periodically in different ways to attack and weaken financial systems.  The equivalent of the X-Prize for the Offense is a mix: direct financial gain (stealing crypto from cracked wallets) or governmental or private-sector disruption.


(ii) Defense. Um, hello?  Is there even a coordinated Defense?  Bueller?  Bueller?  Defense is largely waiting for the NIST contest to finish otherwise no real plan (NIST is great but it’s basically waiting on government to run a contest).  There is not, yet, a clear path for most crypto projects to defend themselves.  

(iii) Independent Actors. The innovation in quantum resistance has come entirely  just a few open-source (but independent) projects. The ability of this code to be adapted to Bitcoin and other codebases exists but hasn’t been attempted yet as far as we know. We will explore the willingness of these projects to share technology and practicers. 


Coin specifications
----------------
In order to incentivize miners to participate in the project,  we join the unofficial alt-crypto launch day of 4/20  with low emission “collector” angle and specifications.

Total supply:     4.2m AARK; 

Emission time:    420 year emission;

Emission rate:    42% mined in first 4.2  years  (i.e., 1,764,000 AARK), flattening thereafter

Codebase:    Bitcoin 

Algo:        sha256

Premine:    0%

Dev fee:    0%

Halving:    halved each year for first 4.2 years, then smoothed.
