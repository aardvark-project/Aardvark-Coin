What is AardvarkCoin?
----------------

Aardvark is launching as real crypto but it’s also a gamified research project—kind of a virtual fire drill—to see how an average joe altcoin fork might go about securing itself with quantum-resistant technology.  Our project forks Bitcoin code to launch a new zero-premine community project with a quick sprint from Bitcoin’s code and signature system to quantum-resistant solution, if one is available today. We intend to document the process and track it as a research contribution. At a very small scale and in limited scope, the project will show the steps needed to outfit Bitcoin with a quantum-resistant shell.
